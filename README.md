# Stylometric Analysis of the Pentateuch Using AI

Modern biblical scholarship holds that the Pentateuch, also known as the Torah, is a multiauthor document that was composed over a period of hundreds of years. However, scholars disagree on the number and circumstance of the authors who have contributed to the Torah with some adhering to the older documentary hypothesis (DH) and many others prescribing to the newer, modern supplementary hypothesis (SH). This work aims to shed light on this controversy using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify the authors of the Torah at the sentence level. Computerized stylometric analysis in this piece reveals an intricate story showing the lack of a strong stylometric signature from the E source over the J source and a strong seepage of the P source into sources thought to be independent by the documentary hypothesis.
